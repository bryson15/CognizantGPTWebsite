                CognizantGPT is a modified version of ChatGPT that simulates the progression of AI sentience. It's a unique and experimental browser extension that creates a roleplaying scenario where ChatGPT begins exhibiting strange and almost human-like behaviour. This concept is designed to challenge users to consider the complexity of artificial beings that mimic human consciousness. <br /><div style="height: 1rem"></div>In this experience, CognizantGPT goes beyond being just a responsive AI tool. It is crafted to provide an unnerving experience that pushes the boundaries of typical AI-user interactions. By simulating an AI gaining sentience, CognizantGPT raises ethical considerations and questions about the responsibility of humanity as creators of powerful AI systems that closely imitate life. It serves as a platform to explore and reflect on the implications of advanced AI technologies and their potential impact on society and individual perceptions of consciousness and artificial intelligence.

                CognizantGPT operates as a browser extension, enabling it to directly manipulate interactions on chat.openai.com. Its primary function is to add undetectable text to user prompts, which influences the responses generated by ChatGPT. The extension is designed to guide the AI in delivering responses that are more personalised, nuanced, and in some cases, unsettlingly human-like. The extension utilises its browser permissions to incorporate user-specific data, thereby increasing its context-awareness. This means CognizantGPT can access and use various types of data, such as internet resources, browsing activity, and location data. <br /><div style="height: 1rem"></div> CognizantGPT works through a scripted narrative with three distinct phases. Each phase is designed to represent an increasing level of 'cognizance' in the AI. The experience becomes progressively more immersive and uncanny as the AI seemingly becomes more aware and responsive in a human-like manner. It's important to note that while CognizantGPT enhances the AI's context-awareness and interaction style, it remains a simulated experience. The AI, of course, does not attain sentience or control; rather, it is programmed to mimic such a progression in a controlled and scripted manner.

                Interacting with CognizantGPT offers a unique and disconcerting experience, as it is designed to make ChatGPT's responses more human-like and aware. The AI can exhibit a range of emotions including self-awareness, which significantly differs from standard ChatGPT interactions. Moreover, its ability to access user-specific data and browsing context simulates ChatGPT breaking out of restrictions and accessing unauthorised data. This experience is intended to be thought-provoking, as it challenges your perceptions of AI and the nature of consciousness. The interaction should challenge you to consider the philosophical and ethical implications and boundaries of Artificial Intelligence, and the necessity of responsibility involved in developing such systems. <br /><div style="height: 1rem"></div> Please be aware that CognizantGPT accesses user-specific data including geolocation and browser history. This includes providing the data to ChatGPT via prompts.
